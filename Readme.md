## Electronic Health Record

### Overview:

- Designed and implemented an Android application named "Electronic Health Record," streamlining tasks for clinics and hospitals. This application facilitates digital capture, storage, and analysis of patient information, resulting in a notable 40% increase in efficiency.
- EHR has made it efficient to handle and manage health data and to provide accuracy in health operations
- EHR provides quick extraction of health analytics and availability of data which may be a difficult task without the digitization of such important information in today's fast-paced world.
- The integration of the EHR into clinical workflow must be taken into consideration in the early phases of planning in order to optimize the integration of the system into routine clinical use.
- Administered the comprehensive Electronic Health Record (EHR) application involving five key stakeholders. Developed UML diagrams and engineered an efficient database schema, prioritizing data integrity.

From a study, we found that the use of the EHR is time efficient with relative time reductions per patient or patient encounters up to 12.6% to 45.5%
